# Ft_Services
Welcome to my ft_services [multi-service cluster] repository

This project aims to introduce us to Kubernetes in order to virtualize a network and discover what a production environment is. For this, the project consists in setting up a cluster gathering several service containers. Each service runs in a dedicated container built under Linux Alpine.
